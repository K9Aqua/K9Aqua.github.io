							<p><p>My canine swimming sessions are extensively tailored to you and your dog’s unique requirements. I offer a range of swimming from athletic fitness for puppies and young dog's to geriatric dog's with assisted swimming. Water has profound therapeutic effects.
Caring for your furry friend is my absolute priority and every dog that comes in to see me receives the very highest level of care. I welcome ALL dogs with open arms and have the experience, passion and dedication to care for even the most shy, anxious, injured or reactive dog!  I am trained to bring dog's of any size and weight safely into the water. </p>

							<h3>Swimming Plans</h3>
							<h4>Sport Fitness Athletic Swim</h4>
							<p>For puppies, and young dogs to build endurance, and experience a full range of motion. It's a excellent way to quickly tire out your furry friend. For new pet parents if your furbaby does not yet know how to swim, don't worry! Swim lessons are provided. It will be good to introduce them to the water should they need other services as they age.</p>
							<h4>Geriatric Swim</h4>
							<p>Assisted swimming sessions for arthritic, Pre & Post Surgical dogs, Paralysis and other Mobility Issues</p>
							<h4>Puggy Paddlers</h4>
							<p>Weight loss for dogs who suffer from being overweight or obesity issues. Water has 20x the resistance of air so 5 minutes in the water is like 5 miles on land. Keeping your furry friend at a healthy weight is great for prevention of future health issues. Nutritional consults!</p>

								<h2>About Your Canine Aquatics Practitioner</h2>
							</header>

							<!-- <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a> -->

							<p>Canine Hydrotherapy was populatized in the UK. The buoyancy of water supports and lessens stress on joints, encourages freer movement and provides a safe environment for exercise. The remarkable influences at the cellular level of being held in warm water are intensely profound on the emotional body.</p>
							<p>I was volunteering at an animal rescue a few years ago when a dog named QT was surrendered after suffering a herniated-disk. After his injury, QT was in a wheelchair because his hind-legs were paralyzed and he couldn't stand. After aquatic therapy, QT regained full function of his hind-legs and was adopted by his foster parent. This inspired me to learn how to help special needs dogs like QT and give them a better quality of life.</p>
							<p>I attended La Paw Spa and completed Level 1 & 2 Training in The Heart of Canine Aquatic Therapy. I have been trained in the safe practice of canine aquatic fitness.</p>
                            <p>I am a member of the Association of Canine Water Therapy.</p>
							<p>Water makes dogs 1/10th of their weight so I'm capable of even holding a 240 lb. dog. Water has 20 times the resistance of air, so a quick 5 minute swim is equivalent to about a 5 mile run</p>

						<h2>FAQ</h2>
					</header>

						<h3>You may be wondering why you might want to take your dog to a pool. After all, dogs know how to swim and we have a lot of natural water around the area, right?</h3>
						<p>The truth is, that while most dogs know how to swim, some don’t swim at all or don’t swim effectively. Pool water is generally cleaner than river or lake water, so your dog will come out smelling like a wet dog instead of a filthy wet dog. Year-round swimming is easier in a pool given the consistent water temperature and lack of rain, snow, and mud. And a pool will not have cold waves splashing against your furry friend, which may not be enjoyable.</p>
						<h3>Do I need a referral from my vet to swim?</h3>
						<p>Swimming can be a great recovery aid for dogs who have had an injury. Once your veterinarian has cleared your dog to begin swimming, we can work together to rebuild muscle and fitness, either after surgery or crate rest.</p>
						<h3>Does my dog have to have all his vaccinations in order to swim?</h3>
						<p>No. Your dog does not have to come in contact with another dog at the pool, and many dogs can’t be vaccinated for health reasons. Thus, we accept dogs without vaccinations. The exception is we do require a rabies vaccination or titer level showing immunity.</p>
						<h3>Can I swim with my dog?</h3>
						<p>No, the human clients are not allowed in the water.</p>
					    <h3>Can I stay while my dog swims?</h3>
						<p>Yes, your dog often enjoys swimming toward you. And many pet parents enjoy watching thier furry friend swim. </p>
						<h3>Don't all dogs know how to swim?</h3>
						<p>No. Not all dogs know how to swim. Often the ones who don’t know how to swim will try to climb out of the water, putting them in a more vertical position. Unfortunately, a vertical dog in the water is a dog who is sinking and probably getting upset. If there is a conveniently located human in the water, the dog may try to climb aboard.
							Some breeds are breed for swimming and have webbed toes.
							Other breeds are not natural swimmers and some, like boxers and bulldogs,
							 have a physique that is not ideal for swimming. For breeds that don’t float or swim
							  easily, they can swim with a gentle assist.</p>
						<h3>How will my dog benefit?</h3>
